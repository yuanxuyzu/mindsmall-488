Start by assessing the damage and figuring out how extensive the repairs are going to be. You may be able to tackle some smaller jobs, including plumbing, electrical work, landscaping, and interior repairs, on your own. More extensive renovations, however, may require a general contractor to oversee the job. But the common repairs that follow typically do not require calling in the big guns."
