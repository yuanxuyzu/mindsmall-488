When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it. Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the "shepherd banging his crook" on a railing, as well as "lots of honking the car" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.

Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into "Final Jeopardy!" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category "Old Testament Book." The clue was, "By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant." Emma correctly answered, "What is Jeremiah?" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts."
