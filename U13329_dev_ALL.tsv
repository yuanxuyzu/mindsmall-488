There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across "a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact." When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it. Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the "shepherd banging his crook" on a railing, as well as "lots of honking the car" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.
