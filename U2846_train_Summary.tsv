Nothing has the power to transform a look quite like a new hairstyle, which might explain why celebrities are constantly switching things up with fresh cuts, colors and lengths. In 2019, we've already seen stars like Rowan Blanchard and John Travolta go shorter (or, in the Saturday Night Fever star's case, bald!), Lady Gaga and Chris Messina walk the red carpet with striking new shades and Hilary Duff and Sarah Hyland show how subtle color shifts can make a big impact. And, if 2018's tress transformations were any indication, there is going to be so much more where that came from. Keep scrolling to see the best celebrity haircuts, color, extensions and more of 2019 so far!"

Yang was joined alongside presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard in calling for sweeping changes to redefine the way that social media platforms are legally treated under U.S. law. Yang's proposals are literally an existential threat to existing social media companies and their business models and he seems to be leading the way on this issue. The proposal shows just how far some of this can go, and as a reluctant advocate for technology, I fear it could have quite a bit of unintended consequences. Yang calls for an advertising value added tax with the goal of eventually making social media platforms go towards a subscription based service, rethinking the legal regime around social media companies, and passing a digital bill of rights in which people own their data and would get compensation for its use. At the same time, Yang does not embrace Elizabeth Warren's call to break up these companies instead wanting to offer quote "guidance." Let's take Yang's proposal on a digital vat tax. I completely see where it's coming from, he wants to reduce profit motives from fusing with algorithms to push bad content. But right now at this very moment all of you are watching this show on an open platform and probably discovered it because it was related to content that you were searching for or you like. Now we both get to win, you have an awesome show to watch every day and we can support the work that we do here. Does that come with a lot of systemic drawbacks? Yeah, and we should address those, but does that mean we want to live in a world where all social media platforms are subscription only? I don't think so. the internet's great promise and gift was openness, the only problem has been that neoliberals sold us all a bill of goods by telling us that openness has zero costs. We can instead recognize and mitigate those costs without destroying the whole system as we know it."
