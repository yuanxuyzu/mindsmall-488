She loves the mud even though she knows she is not suppose to play in it. Look at that pitiful face trying to adorably hide how guilty she is! She may be a cutie but she is one mischievous little doggy when it rains. Her time with the Mud Monster must come to an end if she wants to come back inside. Looks like she got a good scrubbing and is now lounging in her favorite spot on the sofa. Golden Retrievers are amazing creatures and that is quite obvious as they are one of the most popular and beloved dogs around the world. They will warm your heart and make you forget about all of the stresses of everyday life. These beauties are loyal and incredibly loving with their owners. If slobbery wet kisses and lots of snuggle time sound like fun, get yourself a Golden Retriever! The puppy breath and golden glitter they leave behind are simple reminders there is nothing better than one of these fluffy little nuggets. Life is better with a Golden Retriever!"

Footage captured by Marcy Zavala's doorbell camera shows a neighbor frantically knocking on her door, trying to warn the family that the fire was approaching. Zavala told Storyful her neighbor knew they had "four little kids under the age of six and that it was very crucial" to get them out. "As soon I heard the knock I knew it was a fire", Zavala said. "I looked outside to see how close it was to see how much time we had, and it was a lot closer then I could have imagined." she added. The timestamp on Zavala's footage indicates that the neighbor began banging at her door shortly after 2 am. By 3 am, the Hillside Fire had grown to around 200 acres, the San Bernardino County Fire District said. By late afternoon, the fire had destroyed six homes and damaged another 18, fire officials said. "I didn't think our house was going to make it!" Zavala told Storyful. "But the San Bernardino fighters are superheroes they saved this neighborhood!" The following day, the fire department said crews were still working to contain the fire, but said it had not grown past 200 acres, and was at 70 percent containment.
